  caveats <<~EOS
    Mac Runner is currently unsigned. On first launch, macOS will block it.
    To allow it, run:

      xattr -cr /Applications/MacRunner.app

    To get started:

    1. Install and authenticate the GitHub CLI: brew install gh && gh auth login
    2. Launch from Applications or run: open -a "Mac Runner"
    3. Click the runner icon in the menu bar and add a runner
    4. Or use the CLI: mac-runner add owner/repo --name my-runner
